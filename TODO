ColorProof:

merge two proofs together efficiently, ram efficiently

this is doable if the CProof.txs is a dag rather than a list

have simplecolordb record proofs as it goes along, dumping them onto disk

/txid/<txid>/vout/<vout>/<color>/proof
/txid/<txid>/color/<colorid>/proof

these two proof files can be just hardlinks right now!


proof is at tx level, that is, a given tx has colored inputs of that colorid

use atomic rename technique to replace old proof with new (if old exists at
all!)
