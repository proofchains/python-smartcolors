ColorProof:

merge two proofs together efficiently, ram efficiently

this is doable if the CProof.txs is a dag rather than a list

have simplecolordb record proofs as it goes along, dumping them onto disk

/txid/<txid>/vout/<vout>/<color>/proof
/txid/<txid>/color/<colorid>/proof

these two proof files can be just hardlinks right now!


proof is at tx level, that is, a given tx has colored inputs of that colorid

use atomic rename technique to replace old proof with new (if old exists at
all!)


Should proofmarshal save transaction/coutpoint/etc hashes by XORing them
instead of doing a new hash function? Should provide the same security against
replacement, and let the original hash be recovered.
